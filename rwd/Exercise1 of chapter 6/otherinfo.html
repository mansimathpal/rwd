    The most obvious reason to choose a career in Healthcare is the potential to earn a huge salary.
         The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics  reports that the highest-paid healthcare professionals are among the highest paid professionals in all fields.

        The BLS also projects that the demand for Healthcare workers of all kinds will increase rapidly between now and 2026. 
        That means that in addition to great compensation, most jobs in the Healthcare industry also offer great job security.
        
        But what might be even more important to you is job satisfaction. While some Healthcare workers have a reputation for being stressed out (hello, surgeons!), that stress is often balanced out by the fact that they are doing something they love.
         And other Healthcare workers, like physician assistants and physical therapists, report high levels of job satisfaction and excellent work-life balance.</p>
