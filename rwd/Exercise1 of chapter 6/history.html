    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Health Priority was founded by Dr. Peter, who was a known naturopathic surgeon.

    According to Walter Gratzer, the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC. 
        In China, the concept of qi developed, a spirit or "wind" similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma.
         Food was classified into "hot" (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and "cold" in China, India, Malaya, and Persia.
         Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi.
         Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements 
        (Wu Xing: fire, water, earth, wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets</p>
